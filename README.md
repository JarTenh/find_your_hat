# Find your hat

This project from codecademy creates a simple terminal app. In the app your job is to find
your hat in a maze by giving valid commands as an input. :blush:

## Requirements

This project uses Node.js, so you should have it installed on your computer. For more
information, check out [node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

Once you've installed node.js, you should also install `prompt-sync` by giving command
`npm install prompt-sync` in your terminal.

## How To Play

The game creates a random, always solvable map based on your dimension inputs at the
beginning of the game.

Use WASD + ENTER to move your character. Try to find your hat, but beware the big holes!

I've added a bfs-algorithm to find one of the optimal routes. You can view this optimal
route after you've found your hat!

Have fun playing!
