# Find your hat

This project from codecademy creates a simple terminal app. In the app your job is to find
your hat in a maze by giving valid commands as an input. :blush:

## Requirements

This project uses Node.js, so you should have it installed on your computer. For more
information, check out [node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

Once you've installed node.js, you should also install `prompt-sync` by giving command
`npm install prompt-sync` in your terminal.

Have fun playing!
